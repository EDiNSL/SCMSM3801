                        In 2013, Richard Lynn took an affection on a theory called the Rushton’s r–K Life History Theory, 
                        which basically goes like this:
                        <br><span id="highlight">1. </span>How advance a race is depends on how much they reproduce.
                        <br><span id="highlight">2. </span>The more you reproduce, the more horomones you have.
                        <br><span id="highlight">3. </span>The more horomones you have, the larger your penis is.
                        <br><br>To prove that, Lynn resort to the most scientific source possible; he went on everyoneweb(dot)com and press Ctrl C+P on the <span id="highlight">data in 2012</span>, which listed the average of penis sizes per country. 

                        <br><br>Problem is, most of the data relies on <span id="highlight">self-report studies</span> mentioned by King (2020) <span style="color: rgb(80, 80, 80);">(McGreal, 2012)</span>. Unfortunately for once these phallus fit into Lynn's mind almost perfectly, and
                        they conclude that given how blacks have apparently the largest penises, followed by whites and asians, this means hte blacks are lacking behind in civilization ... somehow.

                        In 2015, Veale and their team scrutinized 96 literatures on investigating average penis sizes 
                        and select them through a list of standardized criterias, which for our concerns include - 
                        <br> - penis size was measured by a health professional
                        <br> - at least 50 participants, all are at least 17 years old
                        <br> - a mean and SD of the sample size is provided
                        <br> - erect and flaccid penises is measured from the root (pushed to the bone) to the tip
                        <br> - published in English
                        <br> In the end, only <span style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200);">20 studies</span> came out from the scrutiny.

                        <br><br> More recently in 2020, King did a similar analysis and came up with <span style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200);">21 studies</span>, 
                        but they also include <span id="highlight">10 studies with self-report data</span> which are most often cited, including by which the 2012 dataset (and by extension Lynn's study) is based on.

                        <br><br> So now we have scientists basically doing verfication and fact checking on phallus claims. What do these data tell us?
