                        In 2013, Richard Lynn took an affection on a theory called the Rushton’s r–K Life History Theory, 
                        which basically goes like this:
                        <br><span id="highlight">1. </span>How advance a race is depends on how much they reproduce.
                        <br><span id="highlight">2. </span>The more you reproduce, the more horomones you have.
                        <br><span id="highlight">3. </span>The more horomones you have, the larger your penis is.
                        <br><br>To prove that, Lynn resort to the most scientific source possible; he went on everyoneweb(dot)com and press Ctrl C+P on the <span id="highlight">data in 2012</span>, which listed the average of penis sizes per country. 

                        <br><br>Problem is, most of the data relies on <span id="highlight">self-report studies</span> mentioned by King (2020) <span style="color: rgb(80, 80, 80);">(McGreal, 2012)</span>. Unfortunately for once these phallus fit into Lynn's mind almost perfectly, and
                        they conclude that given how blacks have apparently the largest penises, followed by whites and asians, this means hte blacks are lacking behind in civilization ... somehow.

                        In 2015, Veale and their team scrutinized 96 literatures on investigating average penis sizes 
                        and select them through a list of standardized criterias, which for our concerns include - 
                        <br> - penis size was measured by a health professional
                        <br> - at least 50 participants, all are at least 17 years old
                        <br> - a mean and SD of the sample size is provided
                        <br> - erect and flaccid penises is measured from the root (pushed to the bone) to the tip
                        <br> - published in English
                        <br> In the end, only <span style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200);">20 studies</span> came out from the scrutiny.

                        <br><br> More recently in 2020, King did a similar analysis and came up with <span style="color: rgb(200, 200, 200);">21 studies</span>, 
                        but they also include <span id="highlight">10 studies with self-report data</span> which are most often cited, including by which the 2012 dataset (and by extension Lynn's study) is based on.

                        <br><br> So now we have scientists basically doing verfication and fact checking on phallus claims. What do these data tell us?

                <p>
                    Both King and Veale's studies as well as this visualization has shown that the average size is around the <span style="color: rgb(198, 198, 198);">13cm</span> ballpark.
                    <br><br>
                    While it is not enough to prove that there is absolutely no difference in sizes by country, it is already enough to <span style="color: rgb(255, 120, 255);">disprove attempts to affirm correlation between race and gential sizes</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    The bigger question therefore is why, according to King (2020), do the myths linger on? Now that we know the origins and motivations of fallible information, there still seems to
                    be a disconnect on a sociological level that make these scientific knowledge hard to penetrate into the public consciousness. 
                    <span style="color: rgb(255, 120, 255);">What makes people so compelled to bluff about their bodies?</span> We suggest that culture might have something to do with this, and King (2020)
                    summarized a host of possibe factors, including pornography, media, and gender constructs. 
                    <br><br> Until we get a clearer picture, it seems like men's obsession with their private parts is going to last longer than they would like, for once.
